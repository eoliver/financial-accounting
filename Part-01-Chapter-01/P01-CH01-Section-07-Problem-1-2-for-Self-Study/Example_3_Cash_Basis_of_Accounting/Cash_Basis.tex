\section{Example 3}

\textbf{Cash basis of accounting}. Joan Adam opens an art supply store (\textit{Adam-Art 
Supply}) on January 1, 2013. The financing of the store consists of \texteuro\num{150000} 
in cash, provided by Joan in exchange for all the common stock of the firm. The firm 
rents space on January 1 and pays two months’ rent of \texteuro\num{14000} in advance. 
During January it acquires merchandise costing \texteuro\num{140000}, paying \texteuro\num{86000} 
in cash and acquiring the rest (\texteuro\num{54000}) on account for payment in February. 
Sales to customers during January total \texteuro\num{140000}, of which \texteuro\num{114000} 
is for cash and \texteuro\num{26000} is on account for collection in February and March. 
The cost of the merchandise sold during January was \texteuro\num{42000}. The firm paid 
\texteuro\num{25000} in salaries.
