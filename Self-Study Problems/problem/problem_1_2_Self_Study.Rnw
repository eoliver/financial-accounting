\section{Problem 1.2 for Self-Study}

\textbf{Cash versus accrual basis of accounting}. \textit{Thompson Hardware Store} commences 
operations on January 1, 2013, when Jacob Thompson invests \$\num{30000} for all of the common 
stock of the firm. The firm rents a building on January 1 and pays two months' rent in advance 
in the amount of \$\num{2000}. On January 1 it also pays the \$\num{1200} premium for property 
and liability insurance coverage for the year ending December 31, 2013. The firm purchases 
\$\num{28000} of merchandise inventory on account on January 2 and pays \$\num{10000} of this 
amount on January 25. On January 31 the cost of unsold merchandise is \$\num{15000}. During 
January the firm makes cash sales to customers totaling \$\num{20000} and sales on account 
totaling \$\num{9000}. The firm collects \$\num{2000} from these credit sales by the end of 
January. The firm pays other costs during January as follows: utilities, \$\num{400}; salaries, 
\$\num{650}; and taxes, \$\num{350}. What are \textit{Thompson Hardware Store's} revenues, 
expenses, and income for January, assuming (1) the \textit{accrual basis of accounting} and 
(2) the \textit{cash basis of accounting}?
